            <h2>My overview on ML</h2>
            <div class="work-experience">
              <small class="date"></small>
                      
             <p>First of all , why should we do machine learning?
             In the early days of these applications the commands used to be handcoded using "if "and "else statements" to process the data .Think about the spam filter used to filter the spam mails from reaching to your inbox. One could make up a list of words that would result in a mail being marked as spam.This would be an example of using an expert-designed rule system to design an "intelligent" application.Manually designing  descision rules is feasible for some applications ,particularly  those in which humans have a good understanding of the process to model. <br>


             But this handcoded approach will fail when we are coding to detect the faces in an image . However this problem is resolved using machine learning. Using machine learning , by simply presenting a program with a large collection of images of faces is enough for an algorithm to determine what characteristics are needed to identify a face. 
             <br>
             The most succesful kinds of machine learning algorithms are those that automate decision-making processes by generalizing from known examples. In this context there are two types <b>Supervised learning </b> and <b>Unsupervised learning </b>. As per the <b> supervised learning</b> , the user provides the inputs and outputs , and the algorithm finds a way to produce approximate outputs this time from a new input other than the dataset provided. In this way the computer with the help of data set and the algorithm is able to produce an output using its own knowledge not provided by the user.In this way the term Machine learning can be justified as the machine learns from the data set as humans does from previous experiences.<br>Coming to the <b>Unsupervised learning </b> , it is a type of machine learning that looks for previously unmentioned data in a data set with a minimum of the instructions given by the programmer . In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization , organizes the data accordingly and predicts the output as per the algorithm. <br>However both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques  is important to have a representation of your input data that a computer can understand. It often helps to read the data in the form of tables.

<br>
<br>

             However the most important part in the machine learning process is understanding and organizing the data  you are working with and how it relates to the task you want to solve.

            <h2>Coding in Python</h2>
           <p>Python has become like a basic requirement for a datascientist and other ml experts. It makes things so easier due to its easy to learn syntax , many existing and efficient libraries in python which enables the users to perform a complex mathematical or statistical operations in a single command .
           coming to the efficient libraries mostly used , first comes the scikit-learn libary which is an open-source project. It contains numerous state-of-the=art machine learning algorithms , as well as good documentation for each and every algorithm. I t became very popular and we can say the most prominent python library for machine learning.
<br>
           Then comes Pnadas library used to perform statistical operations on various types of data. It allows the user to read and write the data in csv and other formats easily .
           <br> And the next populor library is Numpy used rapidly for its array feature . And then next comes the Matplotlib which used to plot the data in various types of graphs and even can plot images to read portray the number of pixel present in the picture.

           <br> 
           <br> And still there are many libraries  , which are used to perform machine learning , but these are the best libraries to learn when you are starting as a beginner. </p>

            <h2>Some real life applications:</h2>
            <p><b>Netflix</b>: When you finish watching a film on Netflix and a suggestion appears for your next viewing, that's based on a recommendation engine. Recommendation engines take a combination of individual user data like history of clicks, searches and macro applicable data like geographic location), then process that through ML algorithms to generate each recommendation.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b> Virtual Personal Assistants:</b>
Siri, Alexa, Google Now are some of the popular examples of virtual personal assistants. As the name suggests, they assist in finding information, when asked over voice. All you need to do is activate them and ask  questions. For answering, your personal assistant looks out for the information, recalls your related queries, or send a command to other resources like phone apps to collect info. You can even instruct assistants for certain tasks like setting the alarm etc.Machine learning is an important part of these personal assistants as they collect and refine the information on the basis of your previous encounters. Later, this set of data is utilized to render results according to our questions.</p>
 <br>
            <p><b>Online Customer Support</b>
A number of websites nowadays offer the option to chat with customer support representative while they are navigating within the site. However, not every website has a live executive to answer your queries. In most of the cases, you talk to a chatbot. These bots tend to extract information from the website and present it to the customers. Meanwhile, the chatbots advances with time. They tend to understand the user queries better and serve them with better answers, which is possible due to its machine learning algorithms.</p>
          
          <br>
            <p>And there are many other applications that we daily come across like now a days , many of the websites are also using different dtypes of ml algorithms in different modules.</p></div>

<b>

             “Much has been written about AI’s potential to reflect both the best and the worst of humanity. For example, we have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly bigger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make sure we are building a world in which every individual has an opportunity to thrive.” </b><br
